	<h1>WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD</h1>
	<h2>Louis Armstrong</h2>

	<p>&nbsp;I see trees of green, red roses too<br/>
	I see them bloom for me and youo<br/>
	And I think to myself, what a wonderful world</p>

	<p>&nbsp;I see skies of blue and clouds of whiteo<br/>
	The bright blessed day, the dark sacred nighto<br/>
	And I think to myself, what a wonderful world</p>

	<p>&nbsp;The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the skyo<br/>
	Are also on the faces of people going byo<br/>
	I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"o<br/>
	They're really saying "I love you"</p>

	<p>&nbsp;I hear babies cryin', I watch them growo<br/>
	They'll learn much more than I'll ever knowo<br/>
	And I think to myself, what a wonderful worldo<br/>
	Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world</p>

	<p>Oh yeah</p>
